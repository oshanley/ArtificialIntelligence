What's what:

    NeuralNet.java - Neural Network class; contains all the necessary functions for training and testing a network
    Driver.java - Driver for the neural network; performs training of the network and testing
    NearestNeighbor.java - Implements the 3-Nearest-Neighbor classifier

    ./helperCode - reference code provided by Dr. Salgian to parse the images and labels; also contains a folder of jpg images of each handwritten digit
    ./train_images - 10,000 images used for training
    ./test_images - 1,000 images used for testing
    labels.bin - labels for each image (11,000 total)

How to use:

    Run `make` to compile all files
    To test the neural network, run `java Driver`
    To test the 3-nearest-neighbors classifier, run `java NearestNeighbor`

    To change number of training or testing images, as well as the learning rate for the neural network, etc, edit the global variables (TRAIN_IMAGES, TEST_IMAGES, ALPHA, etc) in NeuralNet.java
    The same applies for the 3-nearest-neighbors classifier - edit the variables in NearestNeighbor.java
